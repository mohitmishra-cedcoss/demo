I agree to your $150 price for the plugin customization:
- Mr.A refers Mr.B to the website, when Mr.B signs up / register (not purchase) then both Mr.A and Mr.B will get a 10% coupon code each
- Both Mr.A and Mr.B can use the coupon code when buying and get 10% off from their total purchase.
- The coupon code generated can be used at check out but can't be used together with other coupon codes and the coupon code can only be used once.
