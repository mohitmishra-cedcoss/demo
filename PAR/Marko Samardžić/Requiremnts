An hour ago I spoke with Jacob William on chat and I asked presales question is it possible to give costumers points that are not based on product/order amount but instead of that to be based on 3 order amount ranges:1.st range: 5 points for orders in amount range 150-299
2.nd range: 10 points for orders in amount range 300-499
3.rd. range: 20 points for orders wuth amount of 500 or greaterJacob confirmed me that it is possible and told me that you can make small customization in plugin so I can have that funcionality. He also mentioned that you can do it for free J
I thanked Jacob for that kind gift from his side and told him that I'll be happy to pay extra if you can do it fast J
Would that be possible?
